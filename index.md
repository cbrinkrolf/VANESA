# Overview

VANESA is an open-source software project which aims to support scientists in the workflow of systems biology application cases. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) and the general modeling approach is based on graphs. For **Modeling**, either biological networks or Petri nets can be chosen. In addition to starting the modeling process from scratch, a biological network can be retrieved from a data warehouse via a web service. For the **simulation** of a biological network, it can be automatically **transformed** into a Petri net by a customizable set of transformation rules. 

A Petri net, either modeled directly or generated by the transformation, can be simulated with the help of an [OpenModelica](https://www.openmodelica.org) installation. Simulation results are made available for further investigation during the process of **simulation**. They can be visualized, compared, and exported for further analyses.

Both, biological networks and Petri nets, can be analyzed by graph algorithms. Models are saved as SBML files, simulation results can be exported as CSV files, and graph pictures and charts can be saved as SVG, PNG, and PDF files. 

# Releases
The latest **stable release** is [v.0.5](https://github.com/cbrinkrolf/VANESA/releases/tag/v.0.5). It is compatible with OpenModelica 1.24.4 and both, PNLib 2.2 and PNlib 3.0.0.

The latest **pre-release** is [v.0.5_pre_2](https://github.com/cbrinkrolf/VANESA/releases/tag/v.0.5_pre_2). It is compatible with OpenModelica 1.24.4 and both, PNLib 2.2 and PNlib 3.0.0.

# Requirements and Installation
VANESA requires a [Java SE 11 (or newer)](https://adoptium.net/de/temurin/releases/?package=jre&version=11) installation to execute the provided jar file. The simulation of Petri nets is based on OpenModelica and its Petri net library PNlib, and thus, an OpenModelica installation is required if the Petri net simulation is desired. A compatible OpenModelica version is given in the release notes, but in general the latest compatible stable release should be used instead of nightly builds. 

The installation path must **not** contain any whitespaces! The installation process will also set some environment variables which are needed for VANESA to detect the OpenModelica installation. A compatible version of PNlib is automatically downloaded and installed once the first simulation is executed.

# History
VANESA is an academic software project of the [Bioinformatics / Medical Informatics Department](https://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/ags/bi/) of [Faculty of Technology](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/fakultaeten/technische-fakultaet/) at [Bielefeld University](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/%3C-de,en%3E/) in Germany. Its success is the result of the contribution of various people: members of the Bioinformatics / Medical Informatics Department, their supervised students, and further collaborators.  

Its development started as a student's project, called *network editor*, before it was renamed to VANESA. In the following, a short project history with the key dates is given.

- In 2009, VANESA was registered at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vanesa/) where the source code (as a CVS repository which is now deleted) and releases are managed.

- In 2010, the first version, [v.0.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vanesa/files/vanesa/0.1/VANESA-0.1.zip/download), was released.

- In 2012, the source code at SourceForge is managed as an [SVN repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/vanesa/code/HEAD/tree/VANESA/).

- In 2013, C. Brinkrolf took over the lead development from S. J. Janowski and shifted the focus towards transformation and Petri net simulation. This change of focus is also reflected by a new SVN repository, called [VANESA2](https://sourceforge.net/p/vanesa/code/HEAD/tree/VANESA2/). The last release of the old VANESA / VANESA 1 SVN repository is [v.0.1.9](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vanesa/files/vanesa/0.1/VANESA-0.1.9.jar/download) and requires Java 8. All following releases are based on the VANESA2 repository.

- In 2021, the development moved from SourceForge to [GitHub](https://github.com/cbrinkrolf/VANESA) and the VANESA2 SVN was converted into a GIT repository.
